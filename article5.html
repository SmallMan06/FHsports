            <p>Hockey may date to stick and ball games played during the Middle Ages or ancient Greece and Egypt, though the beginnings are still murky. In the mid-1700s, a game named bandy was played on ice in the eastern plains of England. During the winter, the players competed with iron skates on the ice. The modern game of hockey emerged in England in the mid-18th century through Canadian immigrants who circled it with people from England.<br><br>

                Hockey’s very physical and there’s a lot of contact during the game. Injuries aren’t uncommon and there’s a general risk whenever a player takes to the ice. Hockey players have to develop their physical and mental strength by learning to play. Because it’s unpredictable players have to know the basic rules and be able to adjust their play if needed.<br><br>
                
                The U.S. had intense political tension with the Soviet Union after and following WWII. During the 1980 Winter Olympics of men’s hockey with the U.S. and Soviet Union against each other, the United States Olympic Hockey college level team defeated the Soviet Union National Hockey team, who were considered the best in the world.<br><br>
                
                The Vancouver Olympics helped Canadians have more pride in their own country. The NHL and NHLPA came up with a “Declaration of Principles”, a commitment to use the game of hockey as a platform to foster positive values and develop important life skills.<br><br>
                
                Teams practice together and become a community of players in their school, improving their social and communication skills.<br><br>
                
                The demographic consisted of 78% of hockey players being white while 6.8% were black, African, and other ethnicities, so not a lot of diversity in hockey.<br><br>
                
                The rules changed by the game going from two 30-minute periods to three 20-minute periods in 1910-11. In 1921-22, the rule for goaltenders was changed to them being allowed to pass the puck forward toward their blue line, overtime became limited to 20 minutes, and any minor penalties were lowered from 3 to 2 minutes. The requirement of mandatory players wearing helmets who were entering the NHL didn’t become official until 1979-80. In 1982-83, the number of players in uniform was set to 18, plus 2 goaltenders. The most recent rule change was in 2020-21, that a player’s skates don’t need to be touching or in contact with the blue line to be considered on-side.<br><br>
                
                Hockey, according to many surveys, is the most expensive youth sport. The Aspen Institute surveyed 1,032 youth sports parents in 2019 and found that families spend on average $2,583 a year for kids to play.<br><br>
                
                Hockey has become commercialized by society to expand the knowledge and countries enthusiasm in the sport, including stereotypes of only Candians playing the sport. Hockey first grew in popularity when Canada began modernizing and popularizing the game in the 19th century. It grew when broadcast in the Olympics and due to the heavy promotion of ice hockey on television by the NHL and broadcasting networks, the top 3 teams being the Toronto Maple Leafs, Tampa Bay Lightning, and the Vegas Golden Knights. The Troronto Maple Leafs were founded in 1917, their coach being Sheldon Keefe and their captain John Tavares. The Tampa Bay Lighting formed in 1992; their general manager is Julien BriseBois, and coach is Jon Cooper. For the Vegas Golden Knights, they were founded in 2017 and are one of the top 3 ice hockey teams in the world, with Mark Stone as their captain and head coach Bruce Cassidy.<br><br>
                
                In June 2022, Minister for Sport Pascale St-Onge froze the federal government’s funding of Hockey Canada and called for an investigation into whether public funds were used in a settlement that Hockey Canada, the governing body for ice hockey in Canada, paid to a woman who alleged that she was the victim of a sexual assault by members of Canada’s male national junior team. The Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage opened an inquiry into Hockey Canada’s handling of the allegations, revealing a history of sexual misconduct cases raised against it, and the organization had spent C$7.6 million out of a “National Equity Fund” -- funded partially via player registration fees -- to help pay out settlements in 21 sexual misconduct cases since 1989, when Junior hockey players first became the subject of sexual assault investigations by police. In October 2022, The Globe and Mail reported that Hockey Canada had created a “Participants Legacy Trust Fund” in 1999 with money from the National Equity Fund, for distribution to its members for “matters including, but not limited to sexual abuse”.<br><br>
                
                We interviewed Elijah Kiser, a seinor, and his younger brother Nickolai Kiser, a sophomore, both of which played hockey when they lived in Alaska. Elijah played longer than Nickolai but they both enjoyed playing hockey. <br><br>
                
                Do you know the origins of hockey?<br><br>
                Elijah Kiser: “I don’t know, the 1980s.”<br><br>
                
                What makes hockey challenging?<br><br>
                Elijah Kiser: “I think teamwork is the most challenging thing, because if you don't work together everything will go wrong. But with ice hockey it's because you have to focus on the movement of your hands and your feet at the same time.”<br><br>
                Nickolai Kiser: “The ice. Once they added it.”<br><br>
                How many players are traditionally on a team?<br><br>
                Elijah Kiser: “6 is playing and 13 total players.”<br><br>
                Nickolai Kiser: “Around six and seven.”<br><br>
                How big is hockey compared to other sports?<br><br>
                Elijah Kiser: “There are over 2 billion fans of hockey compared to football (soccer) that has over 3.5 billion fans. It's a pretty big sport. Because it's not that high of numbers.” <br><br>
                Nickolai Kiser: “In cold places like Canada it's the biggest.”<br><br>
                Who is the most influential person in hockey?/Who do you think is the most influential person?<br><br>
                Elijah Kiser: “Wayne Gretzky, mainly because that’s the only one I know.”<br><br>
                Nickolai Kiser: “Probably Wayne Gretzky.”<br><br>
