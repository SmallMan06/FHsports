            <p>Basketball got its start in Springfield Massachusetts the game of basketball itself was invented by an instructor and grad student James Naismith in 1891. The sport was made to help keep conditioned students and athletes indoors during the winter months to help  them stay fit when you couldn’t play football or any outside sport. It started out as a little activity. James divided the class of students into 2 teams of 18 and created the 13 original rules. The 13 rules where according to (https://springfield.edu) are:<br><br>
                1. The ball may be thrown in any direction with one or both hands.<br><br>
                
                2. The ball may be batted in any direction with one or both hands (never with the fist).<br><br>
                
                3. A player cannot run with the ball. The player must throw it from the spot on which he catches it, an allowance to be made for a man who catches the ball when running at a good speed if he tries to stop.<br><br>
                
                4. The ball must be held in or between the hands; the arms or body must not be used for holding it.<br><br>
                
                5. No shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping, or striking in any way the person of an opponent shall be allowed; the first infringement of this rule by any player shall count as a foul, the second shall disqualify him until the next goal is made, or, if there was evident intent to injure the person, for the whole of the game, no substitute allowed.<br><br>
                
                6. A foul is striking at the ball with the fist is not allowed<br><br>
                
                7. If either side makes three consecutive fouls, it shall count a goal for the opponents (consecutive means without the opponents in the meantime making a foul).<br><br>
                
                8. A goal shall be made when the ball is thrown or batted from the grounds into the basket and stays there, providing those defending the goal do not touch or disturb the goal. If the ball rests on the edges, and the opponent moves the basket, it shall count as a goal.<br><br>
                
                9. When the ball goes out of bounds, it shall be thrown into the field of play by the person first touching it. In case of a dispute, the umpire shall throw it straight into the field. The thrower-in is allowed five seconds; if he holds it longer, it shall go to the opponent.<br><br>
                
                10. The umpire shall be the judge of the men and shall note the fouls and notify the referee when three consecutive fouls have been made. He shall have power to disqualify men<br><br>
                
                11. The referee shall be the judge of the ball and shall decide when the ball is in play, in bounds, to which side it belongs, and shall keep the time. He shall decide when a goal has been made, and keep account of the goals with any other duties that are usually performed by a referee.<br><br>
                
                12. The time shall be two 15-minute halves, with five minutes' rest between.<br><br>
                
                13. The side making the most goals in that time shall be declared the winner. In case of a draw, the game may, by agreement of the captains, be continued until another goal is made.<br><br>
                
                They used an actual basket as the hoop and a soccer ball as the ball. The first official game of basketball was played on Mar/11/1892. In 1904 the hoop was changed to a metal hoop.<br>
                What made the sport of basketball so challenging is. It involves the entire body to perform certain movements in rapid succession at once in order to reach the desired skill on the court. Not to mention to know and follow the rules to an exact science. The first professional basketball teams were founded in 1898 six teams took part in the National, basketball, league. The first team to win the NBL was the Trenton National. The NBL was abandoned <br><br>
                
                One of the most significant changes to the rules in basketball was the shock clock; the  shock clock was implemented in 1954-55. They are supposed to bring new excitement to the sport. Before teams teams were averaging out 79.5 points per game now teams are averaging 100 points a game.<br><br>
                
                Basketball started to gain popularity from the Y.M.C.A. The Y.M.C.A help basketball spread by empowering youth and improve their health, through that they spread it everywhere in the US. When world war 1 broke out the men had to go to war so, they brought the sport with them overseas. The instructors used the sport to help the soldiers stay in condition to fight. Another way basketball was spread by the olympics. Basketball was introduced at the1904 olympics as a demonstration event  in ST, Louis. The first medal was awarded in 1936 spreading the sport world wide.<br><br>
                
                The biggest scandal in basketball history was Tim Dounaghy. He was a professional referee who would bet on teams and help the team he bet on win. Another big scandal was Micheal Jordan's gambling problem but that was a PR stunt to get people to talk about him. Another scandal was Kermit Washington almost killing Rudy Temjonovich. It was known as the greatest punch in the history of mankind to ever connect with Tomjanovich’s face.<br><br>
