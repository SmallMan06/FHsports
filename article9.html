            <p>While Volleyball is an extremely popular sport, there’s still a shocking amount of people who don’t know of its origins— oftentimes even its own players!<br><br>
                Volleyball was first created in the late nineteenth century by William G. Morgan. Morgan was a PE teacher at YMCA. He desired a game that all his students could play easily. This is where he had the idea to combine basketball, baseball, tennis, and handball into one game. Things have certainly shifted in terms of rules over time when contrasted to the original creation. When volleyball was first formed, the players were required to earn 21 points to win the game. Soon after in 1917 it was switched to 15. The changing of the points to win has been continued to nowadays when the points to win are 25. One rule that has stayed consistent from 1920 is the three hit rule. The three hit rule is that volleyball teams can only hit the ball consecutively three times in a row. A rule even taught in elementary schools. Society has not only changed the rules of the game though. Now volleyball has been changed in many ways including the basis of the game.<br><br>
                    Volleyball was created as an easy game for everyone to play. Unfortunately, now volleyball has become fast-paced and hard for many people unless you only play to have fun. Many terms that volleyball uses also seem to have been impacted by society. When a player hits the ball just before it hits the ground with their palm it's called pancake. If a player has to hit the ball with bent arms, it’s called chicken wings. There are many other terms such as raspberry, sixpack, and getting housed. This could be a reason why volleyball is so popular!<br><br>
                A majority of people will think of women when they hear of volleyball games. This is because it’s a sport that is predominantly played by girls. <br><br>
                To be eligible for consideration in an all region team you must be at least 5’5 for women and 6’ for men. The average height in the world is 5 '3 for women and 5' 9 for men. In the Madison High School Varsity Team the shortest person is 5’6. Excluding that you have the physical exertion. Volleyball players must be able to jump and move with agility. You also have to yell if you’re going to hit the ball which is another thing you must have your mind on at all times to successfully beat the other team.<br><br>
                The most common ethnicity is white, which makes up 78.0% of the volleyball teams, and 78.1% of volleyball teams are women while 21.1% are males. With the data 60% of volleyball players are white women as to be expected. These players do have an everlasting effect on some people, enough to be someone's hero.<br><br>
                Karch Kiraly's remarkable achievements make him stand out above everyone else. He is the only volleyball legend to win at every level as a player and coach. Statistically, he is also the most decorated volleyball player of all time. Karch also won nearly 150 beach tournaments before becoming an announcer. In terms of overall points ascribed by the FIVB, Brazil is the best volleyball national team in the world, with 765 points. Of this total, the men’s national team has 399, and the women’s national team has 366. Numbers that make the costs seem fair.<br><br>
                A single volleyball game can make up from $800,000 to $950,000 on average. Putting the players salary from $20,000 to $200,000. Some players do claim to make money in the millions, but even so the referees make up to $300,000. If players make money in the millions then the referees must make more as well. Not excluding the coaches that make as much as everyone else if not more.<br><br>
                Volleyball is a sport for all people to enjoy. It has been a part of human life for over a century. Many people can’t imagine life without it. Helping and providing peace to many. Volleyball is considered one of the greatest sports of all time.<br><br>
