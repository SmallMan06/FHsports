            <p>In the summer of 776 BC, the first games of the Olympics were played. The entire event lasted only one day. The Greeks started the Olympics in honor of their most famous god, Zeus. However, in 394 AD the Olympics were abolished by emperor Theodosius I, and they didn't return until the year 1896 when Pierre de Coubertin from Paris reinstated the games into the modern era.<br><br>
                Shortly afterwards in 1924 the first winter olympics were held, they included most of today's sports like Ski jumping, snowboarding, ice hockey, and bobsledding.<br><br>
                The Olympics, since its inception, has been one of the most difficult and most respected collections of sports to ever be created. The Olympics themselves are a series of sports that are played by people from all around the world, these people who play are known to be some of the most athletic and toughest competitors in the world. In order to compete, the athletes have to be the very best, making all of the competitions extremely difficult.<br><br>
                The winter olympics have many hazardous sports. With ski jumping the jumpers can jump so high, they land incredibly hard and may cause severe bodily harm. With figure skating, the skaters are sometimes pressured into dangerous eating habits and weights for their age. <br><br>
                When the Olympics originated, there werenâ€™t many rules, except you had to be a white, free male, even killing other competitors was allowed. When fighting, the only rules were to not gouge or bite each other. Other than that you had to be rough enough to kill someone, and be fully naked during the whole game. Overtime, rules were placed over every sport and many more restrictions and freedoms were created in each event.<br><br>
                During the summer there are many sports included. The most popular of which are Track and Field, swimming, and gymnastics. In the winter olympics, the most popular sports are figure skating, alpine skiing and snowboarding. <br><br>
                The Olympics have changed many times over the centuries. They were played up until the roman empire took over Greece and banned the event. After a millennia the Olympics were restored and the sports were completely different. The biggest, glaring, difference is that you have to have clothes on, and now women and black people are able to compete. The winter olympics were first started in the year 1924, and had most of the same sports as we do now. <br><br>
                When the Olympics originated, generally only white men were allowed to play. Now, if you are talented enough you have an incredibly high chance of being able to play no matter who you are. In order to tell who plays on which teams, they test your testosterone levels to determine who is on a mens team and who is on the women's team (due to recent transgender issues). Men and women from any country are allowed to play, however, some countries have been banned due to previous cheating such as Russia.<br><br>
                The Olympics bring countries together. When a country hosts the event, their trade value in the global market increases a significant amount. A downside however, they usually do not make any money, and they are frequently in debt for huge amounts of money. It also allowed women, and black people to compete fairly in their sport, and for their country. <br><br>
                In the beginning of the Olympics, it was mainly held in Athens Greece, and famous Greeks such as Leonidas, and Diagoras who were the influence for all future games. Since then it has become worldwide and each country now has its own team with many famous athletes in each country. The biggest teams to compete are America, who has won first overall sixteen times, and The Soviet Union with six victories (mainly due to the use of steroids).<br><br>
                The Olympics are a worldwide sport and they generate, and lose, millions and even billions of dollars each time it is held, every four years. The Olympics have the ability to generate millions of dollars, however previous data has stated that when they are not held in the U.S they lose money rather than gain it, but when the U.S hosts it they will have a surplus of around 10 million dollars.<br><br>
                The most well known scandal, besides Russia doping their athletes, is the Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan scandal. A couple weeks before the winter olympics Nancy Kerrigan was struck in the upper knee by an assailant. It was later discovered that this attack was planned by Tonya Harding's ex-husband. The Russians have always been known to dope their athletes. But currently, in the years 2014-2021 they have been doing heavy state sponsored doping programs and were banned from the tokyo games in 2021. <br><br>
                The Olympic games are very important world wide. They bring us together, and improve relations between countries through competition. The host country may generate millions, or, lose millions. The games also stimulate the host country's influence in the global economy. No matter who you are, you can compete in the Olympics, as long as you are exceptional.<br><br>
