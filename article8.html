            <p>Boxing is an important sport in American society. It introduced a particular genre in which one gains psychological benefits as well as physical benefits such as agility, strength, balance, and coordination. The Sport allowed individuals to box under safe conditions with supervision. Because of this the public was also able to enjoy the game.<br><br>
                Boxing was brought over from England in the early 1900’s. The Sport was originally illegal because it was considered very violent, harmful, and dangerous, but it was still played in secret. It wasn’t until 1920 that the sport was finally made legal to play.  This led to more public games and the sport became much more popular.<br><br>
                The sport quickly became  a way to bond with neighbors. The sport brought immigrants and Americans together through rooting for their home country boxers. <br><br>
                 Television brought the sport of boxing to many new audiences in the 1960's and 70’s.  Which put the sport in a golden era in America. Because of this, the sport became very popular.  It was so popular that the twenty-sixth United States president, Theadoore Roosevelt, boxed. This was a big deal because he was a very large Political leader. “Thedore Rosevelt was a vocal advocate; he continued boxing into his presidency until a blow left him with a detached left retina, leaving him blind in one eye” (main theater). <br><br>
                Boxing gyms became a great place to workout. But just like any other sport, boxing gyms  are typically more expensive than fitness gyms. Because of society's fascination with it, it has been able to profit from their interest. This has led to the sport becoming more popular overtime for its physical benefits .<br><br>
                Like stated earlier boxing had become a lot more popular after Cable television was created. This led to boxing becoming much more popular. During the 1920’s ticket prices were around three dollars. Today ticket prices are around one hundred and thirty dollars depending on what match you are watching. Boxers' salaries have also changed overtime.  Today average boxers make two hundred thousand dollars for their title. In the 1920’s the largest salary made was by Jack Dempsey and he earned about three hundred thousand for his title. This is a massive difference because some of the most famous boxers today like Floyed Mayweather make  four hundred fifty million for their titles. <br><br>
                 Since it is a more physical sport, it is mostly dominated by men. Statistics show that 68% of the sport of boxing is played by men. Some research suggests that boxing is dominated by men because it is a more masculine sport, and is for “real men”. Some of the most famous men in America that play the sport are Floyd Mayweather Jr, Paul Williams, and Shane Mosley. <br><br>
                Boxing isn't challenging just because it is a physically demanding sport but also because playing the sport means you have to face your opponent and fear. Boxing may be challenging but it has gotten better over time with all the rules that have changed. Some rules that have changed go down to their attire like their gloves, shoes, and clothes. Even the way they fight, or how long they can fight in the ring have changed. Some rules have been broken, such as the scandal pulled by  Antonio Margarito, who was caught with plaster in his gloves. <br><br>
                Boxing has left a lasting impact on America's history. Not only did it bring people together during the 1900’s but it also created a way in which people could box under safer conditions. Boxing has played so many roles from being social events, to shows on television, to even economical value.<br><br>
