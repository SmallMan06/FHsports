            <p>Today, football is the most popular sport in America. But it hasn’t always been that way. In late fall 1869, the first ever game of “American football” was played. However, the sport      looked very different back then. It was played as a combination of rugby and soccer. The goal of the game was to get the ball into the other team’s goal. They could do this by kicking it or batting it with their hands, sides, or heads. Carrying or throwing the ball though, however, was not allowed. Unfortunately there were no safety rules. Players would try to get their opponents away from their goals in any means necessary. As time went on, many ivy league colleges continued to play and adapt the game, making it safer and more fast-paced. By the 1920’s college football had been established by Walter Camp and a professional league was introduced to the United States. <br><br>
                Football is one of the most dangerous sports in American history and it only gets more dangerous the farther back you look. 91 percent of players ended up with brain damage   until the rules had to change. After 18 deaths nationwide in 1901-1909, president Roosevelt threatened to abolish the sport if changes were not made. One of the biggest changes that made football significantly safer was the addition of helmets and padding, but this did not happen until the 1930’s when the American Medical Association recommended the use of helmets to prevent injuries. Another addition to the game that improved safety was making forward passes legal, which happened in 1906. Players no longer had every opponent knowing their exact moves. By being able to pass the ball forward, players reduced the risk of being tackled. Football would not be the same game it is today without the rule changes that had to happen in order to stop life threatening injuries. <br><br>
                Since making significant changes to improve the safety of football, the popularity of the game grew substantially. The 90’s is when football had a massive spike in popularity because that was when the rest of the big leagues, like the NBA, NHL, and MLB went on strike for more pay. Big fans of other sports were upset with their favorite teams for complaining about money. They started watching football because they liked that the players were not only focused on money. People also like the sport because teams started popping up all around the country, which allowed them to have teams close to their hometown. This also allowed for the fans of the sport to support more teams than just the first few. With the growth of the sport there were a lot more injuries, which made the NFL start adding more and more safety regulations which made the fans enjoy the sport even more because it was easier to support when their favorite players weren’t getting hurt. <br><br>
                    Throughout history, football has united the country in so many ways. Sunday nights are a chance for family and friends to get together and support a common team. The Super Bowl is one of the most watched events in America where people get together and throw parties just to watch it. Even the scandals associated with the sport give fans something to talk about. For example, when Colin Kaepernick, a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, kneeled during the national anthem it became an event that was widely talked about and made people think more about political situations that were happening in the country. Or when O.J. Simpson went on trial for the murder of his wife, everyone remembered him from his time as a running back on the Buffalo Bills and San Francisco 49ers. Football has a way of bringing people together, whether it is to watch a game or talk about scandals. <br><br>
                    With American football being the most popular sport in America there are a lot of different people and races that help bring those teams together whether it is by the coaches or even just the players there are a lot of different races and ethnicities that go into making up the football teams that we know and love today. A study from the 2021 University of Central Florida about the diversity of the players is that about 71 percent of the players are a race other than white while only a quarter of them are white. The reason why most of the players of football are people of color is because they normally have a lower socioeconomic status than the rest of the other players. meaning they are limited on the other things that they can do.<br><br>
                There are many costs associated with football and it has a big impact on the economy. Some of the costs include paying teams, player sponsorships, hosting games, etc. Football brought in around 17 billion dollars during 2021, including ticket sales and donations. With the amount of money that football brings in it doesn’t spend a lot of the money that they make other than to build things like new stadiums and paying the players. The NFL only spends between 3- 3.5 million dollars per season. <br><br>
                There are many debates about who the best quarterback is in history. The best quarterback talent in history is by far the Green Bay Packers, Aaron Rodgers, from his impossible throws, to his historic passer rating, Aaron Rodgers does not stop amazing everyone with his talent. This future hall of fame quarterback holds more than 30 NFL records such as, most seasons with a passer rating over 100.0 (9), most consecutive pass attempts without an interception (402), and most touchdown passes over 70 yards (21) just to name a few. Speaking of the Green Bay Packers, they are one of the first eight NFL teams in history. The first eight teams were the Chicago Bears, Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals), the New York Giants, the Boston Braves (now the Washington Commanders), the Portsmouth Spartans (now Detroit Lions), the Staten Island Stapletons (no longer in existence), the Brooklyn Dodgers (no longer in existence), and of course the Green Bay Packers. These teams first had a season in 1932. From 1944-1969, eight more teams were added to the NFL. These teams were the Colts, Saints, Browns, Steelers, Rams, 49ers, Vikings, Falcons and Cowboys. In 1970, the NFL merged with the American Football League (AFL), which added ten new teams and kept the name the National Football League.<br><br>
