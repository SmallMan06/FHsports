            <p>Have you ever met someone who participates in an extreme sport? You might classify them as being a daredevil, or even just outright dumb. There’s so many branches of  extreme sports it's impossible to cover all of them as extreme sports can simply be created by thinking of a way to do a certain thing in the dumbest, most ridiculous, and most dangerous way possible. In fact most extreme sportist believe that in order for something to classify as an extreme sport the sport must involve some action in which by doing something incorrectly could result in serious injury. Some other definitions only include the requirement that it must be different from the average sport. This entails 100’s of sports including sports such as skydiving, ultimate tag, and chess boxing. It’s practically impossible to cover it all and that is why we chose 3 main sports. Skateboarding, Bungee Jumping, and Inline Skating. The choice of these 3 Sports may seem random probably because they are. Now let us begin.
                <br><br>
                Skateboarding had its initial marks in the 1950s in California, when the surfers created the idea of surfing in the streets.1 Originally, skateboards were just wooden boxes or boards with roller skate wheels screwed on. As time passed, skateboarding became more popular.  However, in the late 60’s, skateboarding lowered in popularity due to the limitations of the skateboard’s design. Skateboards were revived in the mid-1970s after the development of the faster and more-maneuverable polyurethane wheel and the introduction of the kicktail, the raised back end of the board that makes kickturns possible. Skateboarding was once again popular, as it became more known around the world.
                <br><br>
                Bungee jumping was first started in 1979. It is unclear where it originated from, but quite a few sources say New Zealand. At first, there would be vines tied to a bridge or tree, and they would jump off, and if they survived, they would be welcomed into their society as men. In 1988, A.J Hackett started the first bungee jumping company.
                <br><br>
                Inline Skates were originally patented in 1819 Paris by M. Petitbled. Though patented in this time they are documented even as far back as around 60 years earlier sometime in the 1760s by John Joseph Merlin. Though originally Documented in the late 16th century it is believed that things like inline skates were used long before then to create a skating-like experience in the summer.  As time wore on other styles of skates were invented such as the roller blade in 1966. All Roller blades are in line skates but not all inline skates are roller blades. Due to the difference in design in the size and shape of the shoe hold and wheels. Though originally created as a way to skate during summer it soon turned into just another way to race. It never gained a lot of ground as an extreme sport. Rollerblading was always the more popular cousin and it eventually faded into almost complete obscurity. Until it was considered in 2015 as a possible olympic event and it was brought out into the limelight. For 2 seconds before the people that make those decisions realized it was a dumb idea and it lost all relevance.
                <br><br>
                Popular people in extreme sports are often looked over as extreme sports are often not looked at. As extreme sports mostly are more extreme than competitive. There are however still important people like shaun white, tony hawk, and kelly slater. Who are pretty famous for their sport but not really influential. There’s not a lot of scandals either for the same reason above. Most extreme sports aren’t that competitive so there’s no reason to cheat.
                <br><br>
                Extreme sports are mostly for entertainment. There’s not really a clear definition of what an extreme sport entails and the reason there's not really a definition is probably because people don’t really care about extreme sports. Extreme sports is just a subcategory of sport that contains a lot of sports people don’t care about unless they participate in it (unless we're talking about skiing and snowboarding people tend to really care about those). It’s understandable why it's a way of stringing together sports without anything in common except the fact that they are dangerous. Nobody likes half the sports that are included in this category. This is just an excuse for thrill seekers to do something stupid. Participating in such events would therefore be dumb and people participating in such events would subsequently be the same.
