            <p>Baseball is one of America’s most authentic sports, and it unifies people from all around the country. You can gain enjoyment from baseball in many ways including watching professional baseball, playing on a school team or playing for recreation. The MLB has consisted of 30 teams since 1876 and all of them compete for the same reason: to win the World Series. Have you ever wondered about the challenges or demands of the sport, how rules have changed over time, or just how baseball came to be?<br><br>
                Baseball has grown immensely throughout the decades, first becoming popular in America in the 1940s. The simple, but difficult, game was created in England, but the version we know today was started in the late 19th century. In 1871, the first professional baseball league was founded and called the National Association of Professional Baseball Players. Five years later, the Major League Baseball Association was founded. <br><br>
            In 1900, people knew about baseball from newspapers, but it began to gain popularity when the invention of the radio became popular. People could listen to their favorite team from the comfort of their own homes! Baseball had an active role in shaping the culture of America including games from before the Civil Rights movement to after 9/11. On April 15, 1947, Jackie Robinson was the first African American allowed to play in the MLB. Coming from a family with a single mother of five who didn’t have a lot of money, to going to college and being a 4 sport athlete in college, to then being the first African American to play in the MLB is remarkable. His breaking of that racial barrier was a huge step forward in the culture of baseball for America. As of today, the demographic of baseball is 57.5% White, 31.9% Hispanic, 7.7% Black, and 2.9% Asian. After the 9/11 tragedy, all games were canceled then 10 days later the New York Mets and Atlanta Braves who were bitter rivals and was one of the most important games of the season for the teams because the game was deciding on positions in the playoffs. This game was jammed packed. George Bush (Who was president at the time) had the opportunity to throw the first pitch. That pitch set the tone for the game and brought the USA together and helped unify the country. <br><br>
                Many rules were adapted and changed in the MLB over time. In 1950, the strike zone was redefined to armpits from the tops of the knees. In 1975, the ball was permitted to be covered in cowhide because of the shortage of horses. In 1978, pitchers weren’t allowed to throw the ball at the batter. And in 1988, catchers were required to wear protective helmets while on defense. These are only three rule changes included in the MLB overtime. Baseball has gotten more and more expensive through the years with higher prices for equipment meaning higher prices to go to the games themselves. With people paying to go to these MLB games. The teams are making more and more money. In the year 2019, the MLB’s revenue was 10.37 billion dollars! The MLB in 1 year has to spend $10,000,000 million just on baseballs. In my opinion, I think the hardest thing to do in baseball would have to be hitting an MLB pitch. An average pitcher can pitch up to 90 Mph. A 90 Mph pitch reaches home plate in around 400 milliseconds. In that amount of time the batter has a quarter of a second to decide whether to swing or not or if they do need to swing where they need to swing.<br><br>
