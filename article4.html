                <a class="article-text-header">Origin and how it has changed</a><br>
                &nbsp;Soccer, originally played in England as a college sport, was once a far more dangerous game than it is now.  Parts of soccer included the use of hands, and kicking opposite team members was allowed. At first, the sport did not include the use of different colored jerseys or numbers to separate teams and fields at different schools did not have set sizes. Soccer was just starting out as a sport so designated rules had not yet been established. In 1848 the first meeting pertaining to soccer rules was held in Cambridge, England.  It was not until 1863 that soccer became a feet only sport, a separate game from rugby. However, the idea of designated goalkeepers wasn't put into action until 1909. Then, in 1912, the goalkeeper was allowed to use hands in the goalbox. Most countries in the world refer to this sport by its original name, football. In America, the sports name was changed to soccer in 1945 by the United States football Association, so as to not confuse American football with the game now known as soccer.

                <a class="article-text-header">How soccer grew in popularity</a><br>
                &nbsp;During the time period in which soccer was created, and the idea of more leisure time, people were searching for ways to pass the time. Something to do just for fun. This is how soccer was born, and how it has continued to grow in popularity as one of America's most popular sports. Not to mention one of the world's most popular sports. Another big player in soccer popularity is the FIFA World Cup, which became an annual game in 2005. At the first World cup, in the 1930’s, only 32 counties played in the game. In today's World Cup over 200 countries play.

                <a class="article-text-header">How soccer impacts society</a><br>
                &nbsp;You don’t have to play professional soccer to be impacted by watching or playing the sport yourself. Soccer has brought in new opportunities for leisure time and fun. Playing soccer is a healthy exercise for your mind and body and provides a way to be social with others. Soccer has also impacted society through slang. The phrase, “to move the goalposts" comes from soccer. It means to change rules or make something harder while someone is doing something. Another phrase, “to be on the ball” means to quickly understand what is happening. These phrases, once used in a game, now have other meanings in society.

                <a class="article-text-header">How society impacts soccer</a><br>
                &nbsp;Society has impacted soccer a lot through rule changes and new rules.  For example, soccer players were given different colored jerseys and numbers on their jerseys so that audiences could distinguish between the two teams. Kicking other players forcefully became no longer allowed in 1863 and eventually penalties were added to the game in 1891. These changes were added to make soccer safer and appealing to society. Another impact society had on soccer is from referees using whistles. With whistles in use, players and audience members better understand what's going on in the game. Society has changed soccer to become a sport good for leisure time and hardcore play.

                <a class="article-text-header">Sport demographics</a><br>
                &nbsp;In England, during soccer’s origin, soccer was played by English college students. Soccer has come a long way from England however, and it is now a sport played world wide and by many different demographics. In America, over 13 million people play soccer. It places 3rd in top played team sports in the USA.  The most popular places to play soccer are Illinois, New York, and Chicago. About 78 percent of professional soccer players in America are men, and about 22 percent are women. 40 percent of these players are over the age 40. 81 percent only have a bachelor degree.

                <a class="article-text-header">Economics</a><br>
                &nbsp;In England, when Soccer was just emerging, gate fees were kept to a minimum to avoid competing prices from different Soccer clubs. The reason being because at the time, the fans tended to support winning teams and did not stick to favorites. The entrance fee was kept low, but it was still not affordable for everyone. Now, In America, an average MLS game ticket  costs 50 dollars. A ticket to the FIFA World Cup ranges in many prices according to certain games, and seating. Tickets generally range in cost from 165 to a thousand plus dollars. With growth in soccer's popularity, economics and pricing have grown as well.
                    <br><br>
                <a class="article-text-header">Challenges faced by players who play soccer</a><br>
                &nbsp;As said above, soccer started out as a challenging sport, and that's still true today. One of the most difficult challenges soccer players face today is concentration. Like any sport, it takes years of constant practice to develop enough focus, technique, and confidence to play soccer. However, unlike some sports, soccer requires immense focus and speed. Not only must you keep your footing as you run across the field, dribbling a ball, it is also important to be aware of the surrounding players. A soccer game can be very unpredictable, so players have to keep an open eye the whole time in order to keep up with the ball.
